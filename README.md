# TicTacToe_in_SDL
A minigame project to practice using the Simple DirectMedia Layer library.

## Setup
The setup for mingw-w64 can be followed [here](https://www.msys2.org/). But you can roll your own setup if you want, just make sure to remove `-lmingw32` in the \
makefile so you don't encounter any errors.
